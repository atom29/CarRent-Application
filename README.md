# CarRent-Application
this is my first android application. 
The main idea behind is that this application can be used for renting car for a few days.To book the car user must have to register with application than he can give starting address and destination as well as user has to provide date of booked and date of return. Once user provides all the information application will show list of cars available on date of booking. Once user select one car he or she can add other facility like child seat. At the end application will generate the payment recipet which is payable at office desk.
